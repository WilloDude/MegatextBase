# MegatextBase
A python printart base

Feel free to mod this template/base script and to give me suggestions to make this easier to use


Megatext is a template for making python art using : print/ <>= input etc. This template is used to make it easier to make code



You can share your megatext art by forking this or just uploading your own megatext somewhere. No need to mention me or anything when you share it!
